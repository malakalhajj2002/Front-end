# Front-end
A home decor shopping website's front-end typically includes several pages that are designed to help customers browse and purchase products. Here are some of the pages and features you might find on a home decor shopping website:

Home Page: The home page is the first page that visitors see when they land on the website. It should have an attractive design that showcases the website's products and promotions. It may also include featured products, new arrivals, and special offers.

Product Listings: This page displays a list of products that customers can browse and filter by categories such as price range, style, color, or material. Each product is typically displayed with an image, description, price, and rating.

Product Details: When a customer clicks on a product, they are taken to the product details page. This page shows more information about the product, such as its dimensions, materials, and features. It may also include customer reviews, related products, and options to add the product to the cart or wishlist.

Shopping Cart: This page shows a summary of the items that the customer has added to their cart. They can modify the quantities or remove items from the cart before proceeding to checkout.

Checkout: This page guides the customer through the process of placing an order, including entering their shipping and payment information. It may also include options for gift wrapping or special instructions.

Account: This page allows customers to create an account or log in to their existing account. They can view their order history, track shipments, and update their personal information.

Contact Us: This page provides customers with a way to contact the website's customer support team for help with their order or any other questions they may have.

Overall, a home decor shopping website's front-end should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide a seamless shopping experience for customers.
